* dired-dtach
Utilities to spawn commands for opening files from dired. They require
the [[http://dtach.sourceforge.net/][dtach]] tool. Currently two features are supported:
1. Opening a terminal from directory the directory of the current dired
   buffer (=dired-dtach-open-terminal=).
2. Choose an application to open the file under point
   (=dired-dtach-find-file=). In contrast to Dired's own =&= command,
   the spawned applications are completely detached and do not do
   things like exit when emacs exists, etc.
Usage:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'dired-dtach)
(add-hook 'dired-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (define-key dired-mode-map "\C-m" 'dired-dtach-find-file)
            (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c t")  'dired-dtach-open-terminal)
#+END_EXAMPLE
Customization:
- dired-dtach-default-launcher :: default program to open files with
- dired-dtach-terminal-command :: the terminal emulator to use when
     opening terminals
